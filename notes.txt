how to be enable git in a repository ->
always and always you have to use -> git bash -> 
never ever use CMD, powershell anythign

how to we swithc from one to another in visual studio code

LINUX commands -> most important linux commands -> 

    pwd -> present work directory
    cd -> change directory 
    cd .. -> go back a directory / coming outside a directory
    ls -> list 
        ls -a -> list all -> 
    mkdir -> make a directory
    rmdir -> remove a directory
    touch -> creates a file
    rm -> removes a file

why git bash over the other terminals ->   
    git bash is a terminal which supports a lot of linux based commands -> 
    ls
    cd 
    mkdir
    rmdir

    why we need linux commands -> 

    whenever you have to use a virutal mahcine -> 
         you get an optionn which type server of server to choose -L> 
            linux is hte cheapest and most efficient -> 
                apple oS -> expensive and more problmatic ->
                windows -> it has their own challenges ->

        GUI ->

    when you are using a virtual machine -> you do not have the UI -> 

    .git is a hidden folder -> 

    empty folders are never part of git -> 
        git is a file version tool -> 
        it does not track empty folders ->

    why a feuture development in stages -> 
    1. easy to review -> 
    2. easy to rollback and identify mistakes and startover 

    git commit -m "<message_name>" 
        always and always put a meanignful message -> 

    commit id -> 
    commit 894ff547287ead09ff859a1f457da0cb4a92ae72 (HEAD -> master)
